# Lab 6

## Exercise 1

To take into account multiple CPUs all generating time interrupts, I introduced an array of tick counts, where the index in the array is the number of the CPU that generated the time interrupt. To associate tick counts with CPU numbers, I changed some of the methods in `time.c` to accept the CPU number as an argument.
