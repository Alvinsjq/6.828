6.828
=====

I did not take an OS class while at Yale (due to scheduling conflicts with a required class). I have always
been fascinated with operating systems and decided to go ahead and study the material by myself. This repository
contains my solutions to the homeworks, labs and exams from MIT's 6.828. Many thanks to MIT's CSEE department for
leaving the class' materials online for all to enjoy!
